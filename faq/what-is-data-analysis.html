    <h2>What is Data Analysis?</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Data Analysis</strong> refers to the process of systematically applying statistical or logical techniques to describe, summarize, and compare data in order to extract meaningful insights. It allows businesses to make data-driven decisions, identify trends, and optimize their operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The core goal of data analysis is to help organizations turn raw data into actionable insights. Whether you're analyzing sales trends, customer behavior, or employee performance, data analysis helps uncover patterns that would otherwise go unnoticed. This in turn empowers decision-makers with real-time insights and predictions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>For example:</strong> A retail company may collect sales data on a daily basis. By analyzing this data, the company could identify which products are most popular during certain seasons, which stores are underperforming, or which marketing campaigns are driving the most sales. These insights enable better decisions on stock ordering, marketing, and store operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Data analysis encompasses a wide range of methods, including data cleaning, statistical analysis, regression modeling, and machine learning algorithms. It's important to use the right techniques based on the type of data and the questions being asked.
