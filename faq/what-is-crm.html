    <h2>What is a CRM System?</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>CRM (Customer Relationship Management)</strong> is a technology that helps businesses manage, improve, and analyze customer interactions and data throughout the customer lifecycle. The goal is to strengthen customer relationships and drive business growth.
    </p>
    <p>
      A CRM system stores detailed customer information such as contact data, purchase history, communication logs, and support interactions—all in one central place. This helps sales, marketing, and customer service teams collaborate more effectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>For example:</strong> If a sales agent speaks with a client, they can log the notes into the CRM. Later, a support agent can instantly access that record, saving time and ensuring consistency in communication.
    </p>
    <p>
      At AZ Khonnect, we offer customizable CRM platforms built to suit your team’s workflow, helping you retain more clients, improve service quality, and increase overall efficiency.
